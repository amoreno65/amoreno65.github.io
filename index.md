I am a Computer Science major attending my 4th year at CSUF. I am also majoring Criminal Justice so I can make more options of which kind of career I can pursue from both of those majors. I am planning to graduate in 2025. 

## My favorite CPSC 120L labs

Lab 7
This was a fun and intersting lab because we learned about calculating the parking times and create a function of when you should park and not park at a certain time. It was a challenge to create functions to set up the scheduled times of the parking limits in certain streets based by the certain days and times. Overall, I enjoyed working on this lab with my partner on this lab assignment.

Lab 9 part 2
This lab is really fun to work on and make a guessing game deciding what number your partner chose and you have to guess what number it is. This was a slightly challenging assignment to but fairly easy to work on. There was some few challenges on making the structures of the game and putting it in codes and make random numbers as our answer to put in to the function. It was a fairly quick paced process on working on making the guessing game and we put in a fair amount of work together. At the end when we were finshing making the game, it was actually a challenging game to play and was a fun experience that my partner and I worked on. I enjoyed working on this assignment alot. 

Lab 10
This lab was very intersting and fun to work on because we had to create and make a list of different California's counties and structure them into the data. We worked on organizing and creating the structures using 2D vector and organizing all of California's counties and their populations. Using the strings on the assignment is not too difficult as it was actually easy steps to take in and make the structures to create the vector functions to calculate the list of the counties and populations.It was an intersting outcome of how the assignment looks when we finished the assignments as when we test the functions and gave us a wide amount list of those counties and populations. My partner and I felt accomplished from succeeding in this assignmet as the code functions worked properly. I enjoyed working on this lab assignment with my partner.
